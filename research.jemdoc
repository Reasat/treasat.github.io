== Peripheral Venous Pressure Signal
This project has been my main focus of PhD research. We are trying to correlate the fluid status of a patient with Peripheral Venous Pressure (PVP) signal. Some elementary results have shown promising results that PVP signal is able to distinguish between dehydrated and hydrated patients. We have also developed an unsupervised algorithm based on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter Kalman filter] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model hidden Markov model (HMM)] that can detect anomalous segments of PVP signal recording. Explainable deep learning models have produced some interserting results on our dataset that are withing to get published.\n

== Self-supervised Learning
During summer of 2020, I worked at [https://www.lbl.gov/ Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory] on self-supervised learning on astronomical images. Publications are on progress.

== Rice Panicle Segmentation
We have developed a Gaussian mixture model based unsupervised image segmentation algorithm that can segment rice panicles. The proposed method outperforms existing methods like [https://plantmethods.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13007-017-0254-7 Panicle-SEG] with an average F1 score greater than 80%. Next objective is to come up with a self-supervised algorithm on large dataset.

== Deep Learning with Optical Coherence Tomography 
I worked at [https://www.bell-labs.com/ Nokia Bell Labs] on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) image segmentation during summer of 2019. I applied deep learning techniques -  [https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597 U-Net] and [https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993 DenseNet] to solve the problem. 
== Practical Wireless Communication Problems
After finishing my undergraduate studies I started working as a System Engineer at [https://www.grameenphone.com/ Grameenphone], part of the Norwegian [https://www.telenor.com/ Telenor Group], is the largest telecommunications operator in Bangladesh. I solved some interesting problems related to radio access and microwave backhaul there. A simple example is illustrated here.

A particular cell of a BTS was suffering for low Minutes Per Drop (MPD). As a reason we found that the cell was overshooting at long distances. Which can be understood from measurement reports (MR) of TA = 21 to  31. The cell was using Kathrein 739636 antenna. This antenna has 6 degree fixed electrical downtilt. The planned mechanical uptilt was -3 degree. After changing the mechanical tilting from -3 degree to 0 degree the number MRs of TA between 21 to 31 reduced significantly yielding regular MPD. The red line indicates the moment we changed the mechanical tilting. 
== Adaptive Beamforming with Microphone Array
We as a team participated in the Cadence Xtensa Design Contest 2015. Our team was runner-up among total 16 submissions. The objective of the project was to implement an adaptive beamforming algorithm for a microphone array on an Xtensa processor. Every team was provided with Xtensa Software Developers Toolkit to work on.

== Stochastic Modeling of Wireless Network
We used [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process Poisson point process (PPP)] and Hard-core poisson process (HCPP) to simulate BTS locations and evaluated various network parameters like throughput, SINR, outage probability using Monte Carlo simulation incorporating the idea of resource blocks. We used [http://www5.tu-ilmenau.de/nt/generic/paper_pdfs/D1.1.2.pdf WINNER II channel model] for path loss.
