- `Md' in my first name corresponds to `Muhammad'. This `Md' /is not/ [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine MD]. Using `Md' instead of `M(uhamma)d' is a common practice in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh Bangladesh]. To get rid of these confusions, I prefer calling myself by my last name `Hayat'.\n
